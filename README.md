 Forget to set your alarm this morning?

 Want to take the day off with ease?

 Well this is the script for you! This program automatically sends
 an email to a designated target if you don't turn off a timer
 at a certain time of day

 The email will contain any desired message or excuse that was
 previously written by the user.

 I hope you enjoy! future versions will be out soon!
 
 Plans
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 port this over to a mobile platform
 
 create a more user friendly experience with some fancy gooys(a bit dev oriented right now...)
